The most confusing part for most is setting up the donation “button”. This tutorial will go through the entire process from logging into PayPal to getting your donation panel set up. What you need in order to follow this tutorial is as follows: From here under “Selling online” you’ll see the option “PayPal Buttons”. To the right you’ll either see “Get started” or “Update”. Click this link and you’ll be taken to the page where you can create a new “button”. If you haven’t already created a PayPal button you’ll be taken straight to the button creation process, however if you already have an existing button you’ll be shown a list of all your currently active buttons. To being the creation process click the “Create new button” link to the right of the listed buttons already there. Now that we’re onto the button creation process be sure to choose “Donations” from the button type drop-down. Give your self an “Organization name / service” (i.e. your Twitch channel name or what-not) and then scroll down to the currency drop-down. Here you can select your native currency if you so wish to (USD, GBP etc). There are more options you can modify which I won’t go into on this post but may do in the future. Feel free to take your time and customize your donation button / process as much as you’d like to.  Once you’re done fiddling with the settings and what-not, click the “Save changes” button at the bottom and you’ll be taken to a page that gives you the website embed code and the direct email url. We want the e-mail one so click on the e-mail tab. Inside the text-box will be a link, this link is what we’ll link to an image on our Twitch channel so that people can click on the image and be taken to the PayPal checkout page so that they can donate to you. From here go to your Twitch channel (i.e. twitch.tv/yourname), scroll down and look for the “edit panels” toggle and the click “on” option. Now you can add a new panel or modify an existing panel if you so wish, simply click the “Add image” button, select your pre-made or pre-gathered donation button / image and then put the url you got from the e-mail tab in PayPal in the “Image links to” field. Give your panel a name such as “tip jar”, “donations” or whatever you want to call it, submit the panel and you’re done! If this was hard for you to follow then feel free to check out the tutorial video I made on YouTube a while back that goes through this exact process, some might find it a lot easier to follow!  Please take note: PayPal’s “donation” button is designed for non-profit organizations. If you raise over $10,000 they will require proof you’re a non-profit organization.

Well, here’s how to fix that issue! The reason(s) you may be getting this issue is due to one of the following; Let’s start with the simple stuff, depending on the browser you’re using follow the relevant instructions below: Go to: Settings > Privacy > Content settings > JavascriptFrom here make sure “Allow all sites to run JavaScript” is selectedOnce you’re sure, click “Done”   In the URL / Address bar type: about:config and proceed to press enter You may see a “warranty” screen, simply click the button saying “I’ll be careful, I promise!”Once you’re in, type “javascript.enabled” into the search bar below the URL bar Once you see the “javascript.enabled” preference, make sure the assigned value is “true” and not “false”. If it’s false simply right click and hit the “toggle option”.  Once you’ve made sure JavaScript is enabled on your browser and you’re still getting the grey screen, its time to check extensions!Firstly, lets test something - in your browser open up an incognito window (don’t lie, you know what that is) and try loading Twitch. Do you still get the same error?If so your problem isn’t likely to be an extension (make sure by checking extensions the browser allows to run in incognito mode - if you see no active extensions in incognito move down to the next section).If you did manage to load Twitch successfully then your perpetrator is likely an extension, go to your extension listings and make sure to disable all extensions.Now try to load Twitch again, if it works you can begin to enable extensions one by one until you find the one that is causing the issue and remove it from your installed extensions.Still not working, lets move onto anti-virus / security software potentially blocking JS from being executed etc   There’s hundreds of anti-virus and security software programs out there so it’s practically impossible for me to list every single one with detailed instructions on what to do.Simply, you’re looking for browser, network or web protection that allows you to configure the level of security the software will attempt to abide by.If you can, try to disable any firewall or web protection for a couple of minutes and try loading Twitch, still getting the issue? If not then you’re perpetrator is somewhere within those security settings, fiddle around and let us know how you fixed it so we can keep others up to date!   The part we all didn’t want to get to; Malware can be very annoying, sophisticated and a general pain in the ass to deal with. However, we have some wonderful tools available to us!My advice is to install AdwCleaner and Malwarebytes and scan for any malware / adware or general horribleness lurking on your PC.Below are links to said tools, please let us know in the comments if you do manage to find anything so we can keep others up to date!   Hopefully you managed to get the problem dealt with using this blog post, if not - keep trying. You may of just missed something simple. Let us know how you get on in the comments.

(NOTE: Not to be confused with XSplit Gamecaster) Click here to create a free XSplit account and download the XSplit software. XSplit comes in a variety of Free, Personal and Premium versions, each with its own advantages. Please refer to the XSplit site for up-to-date information on its current status. After finishing this guide, there’s more information available in the XSplit Beginner’s Guide on YouTube. For PC games, you have two choices on how to capture your gameplay. Either by capturing the screen region, or by achieving a direct feed via game source (only available in XSplit Personal and Premium). The screenshot below details where you can find the dropdown menu to add sources;   Games that utilize the DirectX or OpenGL platform can be enabled for direct capture, or Game Source. This sometimes results in better performance when compared to the screen region method and supports games in fullscreen mode.

That feeling of being a part of something special with your fellow broadcasters.  A sense of belonging sharing a common bond within the vast awesomeness of Twitch. But what purpose do they really serve and how can they help you as a streamer? Let’s get started with the basics first though! A Twitch team is a grouping of streamers who voluntarily join upon being invited by a team maker. Typically these people have a common goal, mindset, game, or approach to streaming that binds them together under their team banner.  It’s a multi-way endorsement that says to Twitch viewers: these streams I approve of and they approve of me, so check them out! If someone is a part of at least one team, you’ll be able to see this under their stream title. Like so: Teams can only be created by a partnered streamer (no sub button required!).  The partner emails partnersupport in order to request a team. Once approved, the partner can then go to;  Click “Edit” team (or just add your team url name to this: http://www.twitch.tv/team/YOURNAMEHERE/edit) and add members, manage the order in which members will appear, and add art to spiff the main-page up.  You can add a featured channel to this main-page, review the archives, as well as review stats and revenue for any team member that has enabled sharing these features. Nope! You are free to have as exclusive or as populated of a team as you like. Nope! Commit to a singular meaningful favorite or collect them like Pokémon. To join a team follow below instructions; The three options you also have are to share your stats (partner only), your revenue (advertising, partner only), and to set a certain team - if you’re part of more than one - as your featured team under your stream title. The revenue option allows the team owner to see your revenue if you are a Twitch Partner. However, your revenue remains tied to your account only and is not shared with the team owner or the team in any other way. To leave a team follow below instructions; (Note: read below for the social side of this action) There are finer points of team dynamics as well. Read on if you need more on the social aspects of being in or running a team. Some teams are not active in cross-promotion or pushing a particular brand. These sorts of teams are quite dormant for networking and therefore do not provide much benefit to the team members in terms of channel growth.  These sorts of teams might prefer to show an exclusive circle of friends or a collection of streamers under a network that are not tied together on any other aspect. Often though, to be in a team means you are there to promote your fellow team-mates as well as be promoted by them.  It’s a mutually beneficial sort of thing. I’d suggest you don’t expect much if you aren’t willing to pitch in. Remember, this micro-community only has as much value as you and your fellow team-mates place in it! From what I’ve seen, there are some people who stick to only one team and focus only on that. There are others who are in 3+ teams which all share roughly the same viewership; and in this sort of situation, most streamers in each team often play the same games.  Therefore, joining too many teams in the same game community is only cannibalizing your own cross-team exposure potential. At the same time, your channel shows up on more team pages and potentially brings more new eyes to your page. The choice is yours. There is no certain ‘right time’ to join a team. It’s entirely up to when you feel comfortable. If you’re thinking you wish to try for a career as a streamer, then you might want to be more careful and take longer to consider your options than if you merely enjoy streaming as a hobby.  Ask yourself a few simple questions before committing: do you know all of the streamers on the team? Do you have any personal discomfort with any current members? Do you enjoy watching most of the members? Are these other channels the sort you’d proudly send your own viewers to? Being on a team means to your viewers that you approve of the channels under the same team name. That depends on a few aspects of your channel and how much free time you have.  Managing a team doesn’t take THAT much extra work, but does take some, as you need to create and maintain relationships with the members you’ve invited (you should do this even if you’re just a member), help promote their streams and set an example for them (chances are they are all smaller than you if you’re the team creator), and of course, it’s best if you put effort into creating a logo and art for the main-page as well.  Art isn’t required, but if you want a professional team image, then you’ll prioritize getting branding done. But maybe you aren’t interested in doing all of that management or maybe you don’t feel it’s for you due to time requirements or whatever other reason. If that’s the case, then simply joining another team might be better for you.  Joining another team means you still ought to cross-promote and be considerate to your fellow team-mates, but there is far less work involved and less potential responsibility Or - if neither of these options appeal to you - you can simply ‘lonewolf’ it on Twitch and avoid teams altogether! There are small and big streamers that do not have a team and are not part of someone else’s. The choice is yours. Networking is possible even without joining a team anyhow - so don’t feel obligated for the sake of your channel. Remember that you are your brand on Twitch. Whatever manner you conduct yourself in might have an impact on your channel as a whole and might follow you for some time.  Clear and professional communication is best. I’d suggest messaging the team owner and leaving them a short and polite note that you appreciated your experience with the team but you feel it’s time to move on and you wish them the best. Easy peasy. This article was written by the wonderful Shannon (AKA: ShannonZKiller). I am the community manager/partner for a streamer named Sacriel, and am also a Twitch Admin.
