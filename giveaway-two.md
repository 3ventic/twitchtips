48 hours later and it's time to wrap up our second giveaway, first of all; thank you to everyone that contributed by either tweeting or sending us content (some of you even did both)!

<br>We've picked 2 winners for the written contributions and have used a random selector for those who tweeted using the #TwitchTipsGiveawayTwo hashtag on Twitter to pick 6 winners.

<br>(**Note:** If you're not following us on Twitter and you've won, we'll send you a tweet letting you know you've won, you then have 24 hours to follow us back so we can DM you the redeem link for your Kappa Emote Pack - after 24 hours we will randomly select another winner)

<br>So without further due, here are the 5 winners for TwitchTips first giveaway!

<br>**Written Contributions**

* NoxiusInfernus
* GUIpsp

Unfortunately we didn't receive enough written contributions to give away 4 Kappa Emote Packs, so we remain with 3 to give away at a future date!

**Twitter Winners**

* [@TheAllGaming1](https://twitter.com/TheAllGaming1)
* [@PSRawanz](http://twitter.com/PSRawanz)
* [@TMCBigPace](http://twitter.com/TMCBigPace)
* [@theshadow31](http://twitter.com/theshadow31)
* [@MCBountyCraft](http://twitter.com/MCBountyCraft)
* [@Archypad](http://twitter.com/Archypad)

Congratulations to those above, we hope to get a response from you soon! If you didn't win this time, don't worry! We have much more planned for the future with hopefully a much more expansive prize pool for those that contribute and participate in events!  

<br>Those with written contributions will have their content posted on the site as soon as we get it converted to the working format - prepare yourselves!  

<br>Also be sure to keep an eye on the website and our [Twitter feed](https://www.twitter.com/TwitchTips) for the latest announcements, you don't want to miss out on the next one now do you?  

<br>Thanks again to [Xangold](https://www.twitter.com/xangold) and [Jason Maestas](https://www.twitter.com/JasonMaestas) for contributing the Kappa Emote Packs for our first giveaway!
