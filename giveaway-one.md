24 hours later and it's time to wrap up our first giveaway, first of all; thank you to everyone that contributed by either tweeting or sending us content (some of you even did both)!

<br>We've picked 3 winners for the written contributions and have used a random selector for those who tweeted using the #TwitchTips hashtag on Twitter to pick 2 winners.

<br>(**Note:** If you're not following us on Twitter and you've won, we'll send you a tweet letting you know you've won, you then have 24 hours to follow us back so we can DM you the redeem link for your Kappa Emote Pack - after 24 hours we will randomly select another winner)

<br>So without further due, here are the 5 winners for TwitchTips first giveaway!

**Written Contributions**

* CBenni
* GavXD
* smt923

**Twitter Winners**

* Hoggy2121
* SmoothColaPepsi

Congratulations to those above, we hope to get a response from you soon! If you didn't win this time, don't worry! We have much more planned for the future with hopefully a much more expansive prize pool for those that contribute and participate in events!

<br>Those with written contributions will have their content posted on the site as soon as we get it converted to the working format - prepare yourselves!

<br>Also be sure to keep an eye on the website and our [Twitter feed](https://www.twitter.com/TwitchTips) for the latest announcements, you don't want to miss out on the next one now do you?

<br>Thanks again to [Xangold](https://www.twitter.com/xangold) and [Jason Maestas](https://www.twitter.com/JasonMaestas) for contributing the Kappa Emote Packs for our first giveaway!

Hey gamers, casters and viewers! Today we have a special treat for you all - thanks to the awesome guys and girls at Twitch we've been given [**5 Kappa Emote subscriptions**](http://twitch.tv/twitch/subscribe) to giveaway!  
<br>
These subscriptions last until December 31st, 11:59AM - essentially it's a subscription to Twitch's official channel until end of the year so you can use their wonderful coloured Kappa emotes!  
<br>
We've been pondering how to give these away for the last 24 hours and finally decided on giving everyone an equal chance to win.  
<br>
**3 Kappa Emote Packs** can be won by contributing to TwitchTips, send us a helpful tip, guide or article and if it gives us goosebumps or even a smile we'll send you a redeem code for your Kappa pack!  
<br>
**The Last 2 Kappa Emote Packs** can be won by sharing this page via Twitter! All you have to do is go to the top of this page, hit share with Twitter and tweet with the popup text you're given which includes the hashtag #TwitchTips. Those who tweet within the next 24 hours will be entered into the draw!    
<br>
Be sure to follow us on Twitter so we can DM you the redeem code if you do win! If you're not following us, we'll send you a tweet to let you know you won, but if you don't reply within 24 hours we'll unfortunately have to give it away to a runner up.
