Got the issue where you can only see a grey screen with the Twitch logo centered in the middle? Well, here's how to fix that issue!

<br>The reason(s) you may be getting this issue is due to one of the following;

*Javascript being disabled
*Extension causing javascript errors
*Firewall and / or Security software blocking JS execution
*Malware

<br>Let's start with the simple stuff, depending on the browser you're using follow the relevant instructions below:

<br>###Google Chrome
Go to: Settings > Privacy > Content settings > Javascript
From here make sure "Allow all sites to run JavaScript" is selected
Once you're sure, click "Done"
