Got the issue where you can only see a grey screen with the Twitch logo centered in the middle? 
Well, here's how to fix that issue!  
<br>
The reason(s) you may be getting this issue is due to one of the following;  

* Javascript being disabled
* Extension causing javascript errors
* Firewall and / or Security software blocking JS execution
* Malware

Let's start with the simple stuff, depending on the browser you're using follow the relevant instructions below:

### Google Chrome
Go to: Settings > Privacy > Content settings > Javascript  
From here make sure "Allow all sites to run JavaScript" is selected  
Once you're sure, click "Done"
