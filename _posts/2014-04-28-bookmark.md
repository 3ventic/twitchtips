Bookmarked a stream? Here's how you can delete that bookmark!

<br>Firstly you're going to want to go to http://www.twitch.tv/{username}/dashboard/recorded?kind=bookmarks **(replace {username} with your actual Twitch username)**

<br>After you've opened your bookmarks tab you're going to want to open the developer console (CRTL + SHIFT + J). Once opened either type or copy and paste the following line and press enter.

{% highlight javascript %}
$(".owner-only").show();
{% endhighlight %}

<br>After doing so you will see a "Delete" button near every Bookmark till you reload the page.

<br>Thanks to [Root](https://twitter.com/commanderroot) for this write-up.
