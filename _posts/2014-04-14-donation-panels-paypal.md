People seem to always ask how to set up a donation button / panel on their channel for Twitch. The most confusing part for most is setting up the donation “button”.

<br>This tutorial will go through the entire process from logging into PayPal to getting your donation panel set up. What you need in order to follow this tutorial is as follows:

* PayPal Account (make one if you haven’t got one)
* Pre-made donation button / image for the panels (max width & height is 320px * 320px) Firstly we’re going to need to log in to [Paypal](http://paypal.com). Once logged in direct yourself to the “Profile” drop-down and click on “My Selling Preferences”.

<br>From here under “Selling online” you’ll see the option “PayPal Buttons”. To the right you’ll either see “Get started” or “Update”. Click this link and you’ll be taken to the page where you can create a new “button”.

<br>If you haven’t already created a PayPal button you’ll be taken straight to the button creation process, however if you already have an existing button you’ll be shown a list of all your currently active buttons. To being the creation process click the “Create new button” link to the right of the listed buttons already there.

<br>Now that we’re onto the button creation process be sure to choose “Donations” from the button type drop-down. Give your self an “Organization name / service” (i.e. your Twitch channel name or what-not) and then scroll down to the currency drop-down. Here you can select your native currency if you so wish to (USD, GBP etc).

<br>There are more options you can modify which I won’t go into on this post but may do in the future. Feel free to take your time and customize your donation button / process as much as you’d like to. 

<br>Once you’re done fiddling with the settings and what-not, click the “Save changes” button at the bottom and you’ll be taken to a page that gives you the website embed code and the direct email url. We want the e-mail one so click on the e-mail tab. Inside the text-box will be a link, this link is what we’ll link to an image on our Twitch channel so that people can click on the image and be taken to the PayPal checkout page so that they can donate to you.

<br>From here go to your Twitch channel (i.e. twitch.tv/yourname), hover over “Admin” at the top, and click the “Edit” button. Now you can add a new panel or modify an existing panel if you so wish, simply click the “Add image” button, select your pre-made or pre-gathered donation button / image and then put the url you got from the e-mail tab in PayPal in the “Image links to” field.

<br>Give your panel a name such as “tip jar”, “donations” or whatever you want to call it, submit the panel and you’re done!

<br>If this was hard for you to follow then feel free to check out the tutorial video I made on YouTube a while back that goes through this exact process, some might find it a lot easier to follow! 

<br>Please take note: PayPal’s “donation” button is designed for non-profit organizations. If you raise over $10,000 they will require proof you’re a non-profit organization. (Thank you to [@joehills](http://twitter.com/joehills) for pointing this out)
