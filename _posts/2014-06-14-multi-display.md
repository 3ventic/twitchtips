This tutorial will guide you through the process of how you can use ***OBS*** (*Open Broadcast Software*) to broadcast using multiple displays ie: (Nvidia Surround/Eyefinity).

<br>This is an ***example*** of how the default settings using ***Game Capture*** in ***OBS*** would appear to you and your viewers. Using this guide will allow you to broadcast your center display.

**Step 1:** Open OBS. At this point you should also open up the game you plan to broadcast and/or record and ***alt+tab*** out.

<br>**Step 2:** Click on ***Settings*** > ***Video***.

**Step 3:** Enter the ***Custom Resolution Size*** as your monitor size. In my case, ***1920x1080***. You can also choose your ***Resolution Downscale*** too.

So now as you can see we're now capturing the middle display. For the purpose of this tutorial I have Minecraft in window mode but it will work correctly in fullscreen. But you might want to remove the black bars.
<br>
**Step 9:** Click on the the ***Source*** you added. Then click ***Edit Scene***.

**Step 10:** Point your ***cursor*** to the very edge of the game capture seeing the red border liness. While holding ***Shift***. Drag your mouse down until you've filled the black bars. Repeat the process for the top.

And there you have it. If you followed these instructions correctly you should now be able to start broadcasting in a multi-display configuration (Nvidia Surround, Eyefinity Setup).
