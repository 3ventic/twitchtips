## Getting Started
After downloading OBS, navigate to your settings by clicking Settings > Settings. A screenshot demonstrating this is below:

### Encoding

###### Video Encoding

1. Check "Use CBR"
2. Check "Enable CBR padding"
3. Max bitrate should be 3300 or 80% of your upload throughput, whichever is lower. Recommended bitrates for different resolutions are listed below.
4. Buffer Size is recommended to be equal to the max bitrate. Setting this lower will have the encoder closer to the targeted bitrate. We do not recommend changing this unless you know what you are doing. <br><br> 
â€‹Recommended bitrate for 1080p: 3000-3500  
Recommended bitrate for 720p: 1800-2500  
Recommended bitrate for 480p: 900-1200  
Recommended bitrate for 360p: 600-800  
Recommended bitrate for 240p: Up to 500  

###### Audio Encoding

1. We recommend AAC with a bitrate of 64-128, although this is up to personal preference and bandwidth constraints

Your encoding tab should now look a little something like below;

### Broadcast Settings

1. Mode: Live stream
2. Streaming Service: Twitch/Justin.tv
3. Server: Closest geographical server.
If you are having issues with dropped frames, and you are sure your throughput and CPU are sufficient, try changing this.
4. Play Path/Stream Key: Go to your Dashboard and click the "Stream Key" tab. From here you can show your key by clicking said button. (**Caution:** Do not show your stream key publicly).
