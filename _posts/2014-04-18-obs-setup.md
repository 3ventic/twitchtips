## Getting Started
After downloading OBS, navigate to your settings by clicking Settings > Settings. A screenshot demonstrating this is below:

### General Settings

1. Select your language, and set a profile name.

### Encoding

#### Video Encoding

1. Check "Use CBR"
2. Check "Enable CBR padding"
3. Max bitrate should be 3300 or 80% of your upload throughput, whichever is lower. Recommended bitrates for different resolutions are listed below.
4. Buffer Size is recommended to be equal to the max bitrate. Setting this lower will have the encoder closer to the targeted bitrate. We do not recommend changing this unless you know what you are doing. <br><br> 
â€‹Recommended bitrate for 1080p: 3000-3500  
Recommended bitrate for 720p: 1800-2500  
Recommended bitrate for 480p: 900-1200  
Recommended bitrate for 360p: 600-800  
Recommended bitrate for 240p: Up to 500  

#### Audio Encoding

1. We recommend AAC with a bitrate of 64-128, although this is up to personal preference and bandwidth constraints

Your encoding tab should now look a little something like below;

### Broadcast Settings

1. Mode: Live stream
2. Streaming Service: Twitch/Justin.tv
3. Server: Closest geographical server.
If you are having issues with dropped frames, and you are sure your throughput and CPU are sufficient, try changing this.
4. Play Path/Stream Key: Go to your Dashboard and click the "Stream Key" tab. From here you can show your key by clicking said button. (**Caution:** Do not show your stream key publicly).

1. Autoreconnect: Recommended checked.
2. Auto-Reconnect Timeout: 10 seconds
3. Delay: 0, but if you need delay set locally you can do this to prevent "ghosting." We do NOT recommend delay.
4. Minimize Network Impact: Unchecked. If you are an advanced user, or are having issues with your network settings, use this setting.
5. Dashboard Link: http://www.twitch.tv/dashboard or blank.
6. Save to file: We HIGHLY recommend you keep local recordings on your computer as we make changes to our VOD storage, to ensure you always have easy access to your broadcasts.
7. Keep recording if live stream stops: Again, HIGHLY recommended you keep this enabled just in case you get disconnected, you'll have a local recording to share later on
8. File Path: Select a file path for where you want to save your local files. Not needed if you do not save a local file.
9. Start Stream Hotkey: Custom key to start stream with.
10. Stop Stream Hotkey: Custom key to stop stream with. 

An example of what this would look like is below:

### Video Settings

1. Video Adapter should be set by default. If you have more than one, select the adapter you are playing your game on.
2.Base resolution typically is your monitors resolution. You can alternatively select a monitor to default this.
3. Resolution Downscale is the resolution that you send our servers. Lower resolutions will consume less bandwidth overall, and use much less processing power.
4. Filter should be "Bilinear" unless you have issues with blurring in your downscaling. Bicubic and Lanczos are both supported, but will take additional processing.
5. FPS is recommended to be 30. Note that 720p at 60 frames per second for some games will look better than low bitrate 1080p at 30 FPS.
6. Aero is recommended to be disabled only if you are using monitor or screen capture. (Do not turn off Aero if you are using layered windows, window capture, or game capture. Windows 8 cannot disable aero)

### Audio Settings

1. Desktop Audio Device: We recommend that this be set to your "Default" playback device. To change this, right click on your volume slider, then click playback devices. Then, right click on the audio device you'd like to make default and select "Set as Default Device." Two images will show that process below:
