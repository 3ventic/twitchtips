XSplit Broadcaster is one of the most popular broadcasting programs on Twitch and comes highly recommended. XSplit Broadcaster is considered an all-in-one solution as it allows the broadcaster to edit their stream with multiple camera shots, graphical overlays, chroma key, and picture-in-picture effects, as well as encoding the video feed with highly flexible range of quality options.

(NOTE: Not to be confused with XSplit Gamecaster)
 

## Key Features
 
* Easy setup: Login with your Twitch account and let the built-in wizard setup your optimum stream settings. You will be live on Twitch in less than 5 minutes.

## Getting Started with XSplit
After finishing this guide, there’s more information available in the XSplit Beginner's Guide on YouTube.

### Step 1) Adding Sources
For PC games, you have two choices on how to capture your gameplay. Either by capturing the screen region, or by achieving a direct feed via game source (only available in XSplit Personal and Premium).
 
#### Screen Region Method
1. Go to Add > Add Screen Region.
2. Select the region of your desktop you'd like XSplit to capture by left clicking somewhere in the game window. You can also click the desktop or task bar to select the entire monitor.
3. The selected area appears in your XSplit window for further editing.
 
#### Game Source Method (Requires XSplit Personal or Premium)

Games that utilize the DirectX or OpenGL platform can be enabled for direct capture, or Game Source. This sometimes results in better performance when compared to the screen region method and supports games in fullscreen mode.

1. Go to Add > Add Game and select the .exe of the game you'd like to capture.
2. The selected game appears in your XSplit window for further editing.
 
#### Capture Device (Xbox, PlayStation 3, Webcam, etc)
1. Go to Add > Add Camera.
2. Select either the capture device or webcam you'd like to use.
3. The selected device appears in your XSplit window for further editing.
 
### Step 2) Understanding XSplit Audio
 
#### XSplit accepts two audio sources simultaneously.
* Windows 7 default playback device (desktop audio) essentially what comes out of the default speaker
* The currently selected microphone in the XSplit user settings under Tools > General Settings > General Tab > Audio
 
#### Volume Control
* Each audio source has its own volume that you can manually adjust - right-click the source and use the properties provided
* Sources that tend to have audio settings include webcams, capture cards, video files, etc
* Using the Windows Audio Mixer, typically located at the bottom-right hand corner of your Windows taskbar, you can adjust the volumes of these devices individually
 
Note: All audio sources added in XSplit rely on your Windows 7 Default Device for audio to your stream. In other words, if you can hear it over your speakers, your audience will too.

### Step 3) Selecting Quality Options and Broadcasting
 
#### Basic Broadcast Settings
1. Go to Broadcast and click the right side gear symbol for your Twitch channel.
2. Click the Wizard button in the lower left corner and follow the two steps. When it’s done probing your internet speed and computer hardware, click Finish to use the recommended settings.
3. Optional: View > Scale Viewport > 50.
4. Feel free to adjust the wizard settings based upon your own personal preferences and experience broadcasting to Twitch. You can also seek out tips in the XSplit community forum.

### Step 4) Go live and interact with your audience!
 
#### Connecting to Twitch
1. Go to Broadcast > Twitch Username.
2. Open your web browser and go to [http://twitch.tv/broadcast/dashboard](http://twitch.tv/broadcast/dashboard) to view both your channel and your chat window.
