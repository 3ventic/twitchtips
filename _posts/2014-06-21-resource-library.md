Sometimes it's a little difficult to find resources, thankfully there exists a compiled extensive list of some of the best resources out there that you as a streamer and viewer can utilize!
  
___
**Streaming Software**  
  
*Where would a list be without streaming software?*

* **Open Broadcaster Software (OBS)**: Amazing piece of freeware that has no gimmicks or pay program. Just a bunch of guys that want to offer the best for free. Jim and his DEVS are like everyone else, they wanted a simple a free streaming software for everyone. So they made it themselves. Best part of OBS is that there are tons of [user made plugins](https://obsproject.com/forum/list/plugins.26/) for the program - [OBS Project](https://obsproject.com/)  
  
* **xSplit**: I used xsplit for more then a year and it worked for me for what was offered. The downside is they limited you to a payment plan if you want to do streams over 25FPS and 720p. Nonetheless, they have a solid userbase. - [XSplit's Website](https://www.xsplit.com/)

***If you know any new streaming software out there, feel free to comment below with alittle about the program.***

**BOTS**    

*Some people always say "what is the best bot for Twitch" and I can never say just one. Each bot offers different user interfaces and features. My suggestion is to try each one out for a week and make your own decision off what works for you and your stream.*  
  
* **Nightbot**: Nightbot is a free and very well developed chat moderation bot that offers custom command, moderation and other cool features for your Twitch.tv chat! - [NightBot's Website](http://www.nightbot.tv/index.php)  
  
* **Moobot**: I think this is the official chat moderation bot of Twitch (not sure tho) and offers some interesting features with it. It has a solid user base and can be added with in minutes with a simple setup. - [Moobot's Website](http://twitch.moobot.tv/)  
  
* **Xanbot**: Xanbot is a smaller chat moderation bot created by a Twitch Staff Member named Xangold. It has very simple commands and with Xangold behind the helm, it is going to keep growing. - [Xangold's Twitch Channel](http://www.twitch.tv/xangold)  
  
* **Deep Bot** The only bot to have a space in its name and more features then you can wave a Kappa at. Deep Bot is a "all-in-one" bot for your stream that allows you to manage music playing, song requests, loyalty points, title and current game, commands and timed messages - [DeepBot's Website](http://deepbot.deep.sg/)  
  
***I know I missed some other bots but please feel free to share them below and why you like them.***

**BROWSER ADDONS**  
  
*Browser addons can change your whole experience when using Twitch*

* **BetterTTV**: This is a browser addon that adds a couple of fixes for the current Twitch experiences like “darkened themed” and [additional emotes](http://nightdev.com/betterttv/faces.php) - [BetterTTV](http://www.nightdev.com/betterttv/)

There are a lot of Devs out there pushing their alert/notifications apps on people and that is great! I assure most people have heard of the main 2 but there are some interesting one being developed.  
  
* **NightDev Alerts**: Now this might seem bias because I do support for NightDev part-time but I had to mention Night's countless hard work on offering follower, sub and donation alerts for OBS and xSplit. I have been using them since day one. - [NightDev's Website](http://www.nightdev.com/)  
  
* **TNotifier** Oyed is the guy behind this browser based follower, sub and donation alert system and it offers straight to the point notifications. He offers a basic payment plan for the use and a totally free member to partners. [TNotifier's Website](https://tnotifier.net/)  

* **Chatty** Chatty is a simple to use IRC for you computer to keep track of your viewers and interact with them easier. This IRC aslo allows Twitch emotes to be seen. It has a lot of wicked features for ease of streaming. - [Chatty's SourceForge Page](http://getchatty.sourceforge.net/)
