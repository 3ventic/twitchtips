Sometimes it's a little difficult to find resources, thankfully there exists a compiled extensive list of some of the best resources out there that you as a streamer and viewer can utilize!
  
##Streaming Software 
  
*What would a list be without streaming software?*

* **Open Broadcaster Software (OBS)**: Amazing piece of freeware that has no gimmicks or pay program. Just a bunch of guys that want to offer the best for free. Jim and his devs are like everyone else, they wanted a simple a free streaming software for everyone. So they made it themselves. Best part of OBS is that there are tons of [user made plugins](https://obsproject.com/forum/list/plugins.26/) for the program - [OBS Project](https://obsproject.com/)  
  
* **xSplit**: I used xsplit for more then a year and it worked for me for what was offered. The downside is they limited you to a payment plan if you want to do streams over 25FPS and 720p. Nonetheless, they have a solid userbase. - [XSplit's Website](https://www.xsplit.com/)

***If you know any new streaming software out there, feel free to comment below with alittle about the program.***
  
##Bots    

For Bots it's recommended to check out the in-depth post on Twitch Chat Moderation Bots which can be [found here](http://twitchtips.com/chat-moderation-bots/)!  

##Browser Addons
  
*Browser addons can change your whole experience when using Twitch*

* **BetterTTV**: This is a browser addon that adds a couple of fixes for the current Twitch experiences like “darkened themed” and [additional emotes](http://nightdev.com/betterttv/faces.php) - [BetterTTV](http://www.nightdev.com/betterttv/)  

***I know there are more browser addons out there but have no experience with them. Please feel free to give them in the comments below and a brief explanation of them!***  
  
##Steam Alerts/Notifactions & Apps

There are a lot of Devs out there pushing their alert/notifications apps on people and that is great! I assure most people have heard of the main 2 but there are some interesting one being developed.  
  
* **NightDev Alerts**: Now this might seem bias because I do support for NightDev part-time but I had to mention Night's countless hard work on offering follower, sub and donation alerts for OBS and xSplit. I have been using them since day one. - [NightDev's Website](http://www.nightdev.com/)  
  
* **TNotifier**: Oyed is the guy behind this browser based follower, sub and donation alert system and it offers straight to the point notifications. He offers a basic payment plan for the use and a totally free member to partners. - [TNotifier's Website](https://tnotifier.net/)  

* **Chatty**: Chatty is a simple to use IRC for you computer to keep track of your viewers and interact with them easier. This IRC aslo allows Twitch emotes to be seen. It has a lot of wicked features for ease of streaming. - [Chatty's SourceForge Page](http://getchatty.sourceforge.net/)

##Links  
I always have these bookmarked because I never know when I will need them. Some are more common then others but all offer something we need at some point.
