## Community Contributions
So you're looking to contribute to the Twitch Tips blog? Glad to hear it!    
<br>
Firstly lets just get down to some general points.    
<br>
Twitch Tips is designed so that anyone and everyone can find helpful content written by fellow members of the Twitch community easily.    
<br>
Whether you're writing about hardware, software or general community building; we'd love to have you write content for others!    
<br>
At the moment we're using Jekyll, blogging software ran and hosted on GitHub. Posts are written in a markdown format (.md).    
<br>
We don't expect everyone to know how to write their stuff in markdown but if you do you'll find basics further into the post.
<br>     
If you're unsure about markdown, no problem - simply write up your content in a normal word processor (Sublime Text, Google Docs etc) and send us an email with said content at: [contact@twitchtips.com](mailto:contact@twitchtips.com).    
<br>
Alternatively, if you're comfortable with markdown, below is the basic template you should use;

{% highlight bash %}

Content text here, blah blah blah filler.
{% endhighlight %}

You can then send your post to [contact@twitchtips.com](mailto:contact@twitchtips.com), or fork our repo over at [Github](http://github.com/TwitchTips/twitchtips) and send us a pull-request.    
<br>
If you are sending a pull-request, put your post in a file named Year-month-day-title.md in the _posts directory (Eg, 2014-04-19-contribute.md).
